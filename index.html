        <h1>Welcome to Randy's Gator Farm</h1>
        <p>Your source for primordial terror.</p>
        <p>Deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. <br> 
            Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. <br>
            A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.</p>
